<h1>The Best Movies According to Coney</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>Really funny movie with lots of action and an interesting plot, like really interesting. I love the way it all comes together.
</p>

<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>I loved this movie as a kid, at first it was scary but then I started liking it. It has some incredible action, nice robot designs; and even though the plot isn't that good the fights make it an awesome movie</p>

<h3>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</h3>
<p>Bandersnatch is very interesting. I remember wanting to watch it when it came out, because of the "choosing" feature this movie includes. All in all it has multiple endings (the "secret" one being very sad), and I think it's very neat. </p>
